    Government departments, such as the Ministry of Defence, produce a large amount of written communications that are essential for the international operations of government. Freedom of Information Laws legislate that these documents should be released to the public. However, many of these documents contain sensitive information and, therefore, the document needs to be reviewed to identify and withhold any sensitivities. This website aims to be a sensitivity review application that integrates automatic sensitivity classification. This system displays documents to a reviewer along with a classifier's predictions as to whether the documents contain any sensitive information. Importantly, the system provides the reviewer with useful information to explain why the classifier has predicted that a document is (not) sensitive, such as colour coded highlighting of important term features within a document. The system produces useful reports to visualise the similarities and differences between what the classifier belives to be the most important features of sensitivity and features that are present in the collection being reviewed. Moreover, the system should also allow the reviewer to provide positive and negative feedback to the classifier about document features that the reviewer believes to be indicative of (non-)sensitivity, and inform the reviewer of how this new information will be integrated to update the current classification model.
